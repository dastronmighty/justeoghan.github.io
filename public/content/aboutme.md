### Hi ðŸ‘‹  
  
I'm Eoghan, a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science from University College Dublin. My journey into AI began with modding Minecraftâ€”creating new mobs and mods ignited my curiosity, turning what started as a hobby into a fulfilling career.  
  
I'm particularly fascinated by Reinforcement Learning, and I'm passionate about leveraging machine learning to drive meaningful change. I strongly believe in the power of open-source software and the importance of providing free access to knowledge for everyone.
