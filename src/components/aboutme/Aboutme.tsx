                        Hi ðŸ‘‹ <br /> I'm Eoghan, a self-taught programmer turned B.Sc. in Computer Science, with a focus on Data Science. My journey into AI began with modding Minecraftâ€”creating new mobs and mods really sparked my curiosity, and what started as a hobby soon grew into a career.
                        I'm particularly fascinated by Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning, and Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging Machine Learning to create meaningful change. I strongly believe in the power of open-source software and ensuring free access to knowledge for everyone, with the goal of building a better world through technology.
